Sea Ranger Service - World's first maritime ranger service!

For the Sea Rangers, we created a platform named Paper Trail in which every team member has a clear overview of all the 
agendas of meetings they attend. Every meeting follows our accountability format. Agenda points are easily recorded centrally by 
each team and after a meeting has been concluded, each member receives her action points. This creates a trail of meetings with agenda and 
action items for each team over time, hence the name Paper Trail.

''The flexibility given by Pharo and its excellent support for Agile Development is a huge productivity boost.
It helps us to adapt to customer needs and deliver high quality products.'' said J. van Alteren CEO of ObjectGuild
